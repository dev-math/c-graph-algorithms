# C Graph Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of graph algorithms implemented in C. It provides implementations for various graph operations, including different representations of graphs and algorithms for graph traversal, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, and more.

## Installation

To use the algorithms and run the test files, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-math/c-graph-algorithms.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd c-graph-algorithms
```

## Usage

### Algorithm Implementations

The algorithm implementations can be found in the `src` directory. The repository provides implementations for various graph algorithms and data structures.

### Running Test Files

The test files can be found in the `test` directory. Each test file corresponds to a specific algorithm implementation.

To run a test file, you need to compile it along with the corresponding algorithm implementation and any dependencies.

For example, to run the test file for a specific algorithm, execute the following commands:

```bash
gcc src/algorithm.c test/test_algorithm.c -o test_algorithm
./test_algorithm
```

This will compile the algorithm implementation along with the test file and execute the resulting program.
